I'm a PhD student at the [Technion](https://theory.cs.technion.ac.il/), fortunate to be advised by [Keren Censor-Hillel](https://ckeren.net.technion.ac.il/).
Before that, I received my MSc from Tel-Aviv University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Adam Morrison](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mad/).
